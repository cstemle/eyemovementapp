## About This Project
This application is an example of using Javascript for DOM manipulation. The application is designed so that the "eyes" on screen will follow your movements.

## Directions
Simply move your cursor around the screen and watch the magic!

## Future Roadmap
The goal for the future is to continually work on the effects until I can achieve extremely realistic results.
